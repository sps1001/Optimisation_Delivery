Personalized Route Optimization for Delivery System
Description
This project is designed to optimize delivery routes for a logistics company. It considers factors like traffic, weather conditions, and customer preferences to predict delivery times and suggest the most efficient routes for delivery personnel. By combining advanced data structures and AI/ML techniques, the system provides real-time route updates and enhances the efficiency of deliveries.

Features
Real-Time Route Optimization: Dynamically adjusts delivery routes based on traffic and weather conditions.
Traffic and Delivery Time Prediction: Uses historical and live data to predict delivery times.
AI/ML Integration: Implements regression models to predict traffic and optimize routes.
Interactive Map Visualization: Visualize routes using Google Maps integration.
Caching Mechanism: Stores frequently used or computed routes to reduce computation time.

Data Structures and Algorithms Used
Graphs: Represents the city map (nodes as locations and edges as roads).
Priority Queue: Utilized in Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest or fastest route.
HashMap: Caches previously computed routes and traffic data for efficient retrieval.
Sliding Window: Handles real-time traffic and delivery time updates.

AI/ML Integration
Delivery Time Prediction: Uses regression models on historical delivery data to predict accurate times.
Dynamic Route Optimization: Adjusts delivery routes based on real-time traffic data.
